# Sprint3

This is a project for CPSC Applications of Databases at the University of Mary Washington. This assignment is to test our ability to make a web application using an SQL database. The SQL database we are using is PostgreSQL.

Steps to set up website:

1. Download or clone the git repository
2. Put files on server 
3. Make sure to have Flask, python, psycopg2, flask-socketio, and a postgresql database installed
4. Create database with the "movies.sql" file
5. Start your database management system (eg. postgresql)
6. Start "server.py"
7. Create an account on the website
    7.1. To create admins, you have to go into your PostgreSQL database and put 1 in the users.isAdmin column
8. Search and rate movies
9. Once one movie has been rated, you can recieve recommendations for movies
10. You can change you rating and comments about a movie by re-rating it
11. Enjoy the site
